/**
 * Devourer is a cell that can kill(devour) other cells
 * If the Devourer has 1 neighbour and is alive, it will devour it 
 * It cannot devour another cell if it has more than 1 neighbour
 * If the Devourer is dead and has 1 neighbour, it will come back to life
 * If the Devourer has no neighbours or has not devoured in 5 generations, it will die
 * Devourers can kill eachother
 * 
 * Due to continuity, it is necessary to create a new devoured variable in the Cell abstract class to determine death
